# React Code Test - Schibsted Norge SMB

## Introduction

We have set up a very barebones React project for you. Among dependencies you will find Typescript, React, Styled Components and React Router. These are libraries we use daily and therefore you want to solve the problem with them. You can add extra dependencies if you feel it's necessary. If so, please explain why.

In the project folder you will find a simple wireframe to explain the app (Wireframe.jpg). Design will not be considered, but we require you to write some CSS. It's up to you whether you want to add functionality beyond what is shown on the wireframe.

Document your code and choices along the way in the form of comments and/or in `DOCUMENTATION.md`. You do not need to write comprehensive documentation, but enough to help us understand your choices.

note: we generally use webpack at work but for this we will be using parcel for simplicity

## Tasks

You will create a Todo application. Here is a list of features and requirements of the application:

- Support at least three Todo lists
- Remember which Todos are in which list
- Remember the status of each Todo
- Creating Todos in each list
- Mark Todos as done / not done
- Delete Todos
- Data should still be available at page refresh
